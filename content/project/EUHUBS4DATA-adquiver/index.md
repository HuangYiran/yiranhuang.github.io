title: European Federation of Data Driven Innovation Hubs
summary: Project adds value to all functional areas of the hotel and can be utilised in two waysd epending on the user profile Dashboard as a Service (DaaS) for final consumers; responsible for managing the different functional areas of the hotel; Platform as a Service (PaaS), for hotels with a dedicated data team able to use the technology and enabled datasets to generate their own dashboards. The main need covered by our solution is to predict the behaviour of the hotel's KPIs to make decisions based on data, focusing on the following specific needs like Reserves forecast, Revenue prediction, Anticipating cancellations and so on.

A high percentage of hotels rely on monolithic information management systems but lack
operating systems and procedures which allow for data-driven decisions. In this context, the
experiment will centre on the transformational changes experienced by the Hotel as it moves
from a reactive to a predictive approach of data exploitation through the development of use
cases with the capacity to be productive in a data space environment.
Currently, based on the experience with our clients, the Hotel has evolved to a data-driven
approach with the development of descriptive analytics use cases, based on the aggregation
of historical data and representation in dashboards. This first approach speeds up the
consumption of and centralises access to information.
In the second stage of maturity, these are combined with external data sources that offer a
view of the organisation's context and environment, generating competitive and business
intelligence as a result.
The last approach is advanced analytics, enabling predictions and extraction of information
from the data beyond the obvious conclusions by applying supervised and unsupervised
machine learning models. This approach is a greater challenge but yields the greatest benefit
to the hotel from the data.
In this experiment, AdQuiver will deploy its MoirAI data platform and will use proposed
services and datasets in order to implement three use cases for a Hotel client. These use
cases, outlined below, are central to the experiment, the activities and themselves represent
a key milestone.
(A) A dynamic booking and incomes predictor
(B) A probabilistic cancellation classifier
(C) An unsupervised clustering of demand
The use cases will give rise to prediction models to be productized through containers (light
virtualizations). Together with the generated datasets, after aggregations and predictions,
they can be deployed in data space environments.

Operational data from the Property Management System (PMS), data from programmatic
marketing campaigns and EUHubs4Data datasets will be used for its development.
The maturity of the developments and their proximity to the market is high (TRL 7-9).
AdQuiver has trialled the use of descriptive analysis and business intelligence solutions with
direct applications on the daily operations of clients and has the knowledge and equipment to
implement predictive analytics use cases.
