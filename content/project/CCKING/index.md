title: Competence Center for AI Engineering
summary: Karlsruhe Competence Center for AI Engineering (CC-King) project aimed at integrating cutting-edge AI research with traditional engineering. This initiative focuses on the practical application of AI and Machine Learning (ML) within industrial production and mobility sectors. Supported by the Ministry of Economics, Labor and Housing of Baden-Württemberg, CC-King offers companies practical AI/ML support, fostering the development of intelligent systems. A collaborative effort among Karlsruhe's premier institutions, including the Fraunhofer IOSB, FZI Research Center, and KIT, the project seeks to "professionalize" AI engineering, bridging it with established engineering processes for strategic AI deployment in business.

CC-KING is the competence center for AI engineering of the Karlsruhe research institutes Fraunhofer Institute of Optronics, System Technologies and Image Exploitation IOSB, FZI Research Center for Information Technology and Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). It represents a link between cutting-edge AI research and established engineering disciplines and is intended to facilitate the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) methods in practice.

Many companies have a wealth of data that they could use to create value with the help of AI. At the same time, however, there is often a lack of AI expertise, and the gap is difficult to close because AI experts are rare and generally unfamiliar with the typical application domains. This is why CC-KING offers companies concrete support.

The competence center conducts research in close contact with companies on fundamental questions, practical methodologies and specific application problems from the contexts of industrial production and mobility. Existing research initiatives such as the Karlsruhe Research Factory and the Baden-Württemberg autonomous driving test field serve as real-world laboratories for the key areas.

In addition to workshops and conferences on the topic of AI engineering, the results from CC-KING are transferred directly to companies via QuickChecks and TransferChecks. QuickChecks are individual consulting services for end users that support the use of AI and ML technologies.
