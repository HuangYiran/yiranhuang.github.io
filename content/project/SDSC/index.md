Smart Data Solution Center (SDSC) a dynamic initiative aimed at propelling the digital transformation journey of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

Within the SDSC, I had the privilege of collaborating with two leading entities: the esteemed Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, providing robust computing power and technical expertise, and SICOS GmbH, entrusted with customer liaison and the ongoing maintenance and evolution of our digital platform.

My role as a data analyst from 2019 to 2024 was diverse and impactful, encompassing three primary domains:
Data Analysis: I spearheaded projects offering tailored data modeling and analytical services to SMEs. Through meticulous examination of client data, we unearthed latent potentials or crafted bespoke models to address specific client needs. Each project spanned 2 to 3 months, fostering profound insights and actionable strategies.

Workshops: A cornerstone of our endeavor, workshops served as vibrant knowledge-sharing forums. We organized large-scale seminars featuring esteemed professors and seasoned entrepreneurs, delving into the nuances of digitalization, common challenges, and practical insights. Additionally, tailored workshops catered directly to the needs of individual SMEs, fostering collaborative problem-solving and strategic brainstorming sessions.

Website Development and Maintenance: Our digital footprint played a pivotal role in disseminating insights and fostering community engagement. I contributed to curating and maintaining a dynamic website replete with informative blogs, insightful demos, and invaluable resources pertinent to enterprise digitization. This platform served as a beacon of knowledge and a hub for fostering ongoing dialogue.

My journey within the SDSC has been enriching, marked by continuous learning, innovation, and meaningful collaborations. Through my multifaceted involvement across data analysis, workshops, and digital platform management, I've been privileged to contribute to the advancement of SMEs on their transformative digital journeys.

<!-- Smart Data Solution Center (SDSC)旨在加快中小型企业的数字化转型过程。它通过实践的方式向中小型企业展示数据化的魅力，解答数字化过程中遇到的问题和提出相应的指导。SDSC主要由两个公司进行主导。一个是Karlsruhe Institute of Technolofy, 主要提供算力和技术支援。另一个是sicos gmhb，主要负责和客户的联系以及网站的维护和开发。

SDSC项目主要以三种形式展开工作。第一，数据分析：为具体的中小型企业提供数据建模和分析服务。通过分析客户提供的数据，挖掘数据中的潜力，或针对客户提出的需求进行建模。每个项目持续2到3个月。第二，workshop。分为两种，一种是举办大型研讨会，邀请学校的教授和一些有过数字化经验的企业家进行演讲。主题一般是数字化的发展前景，常见问题和实际经验。这种workshop一般持续一天，一年一次。另一种workshop则是针对具体的中小型企业的。在和企业的主管取得联系后，我们会组织一个小型的workshop，针对企业具体的问题，有针对性的进行讨论，分析和解答。第三，网站。项目维护和一个网站，并在网站中提供了企业数字化相关blog，demo和其他资源。
