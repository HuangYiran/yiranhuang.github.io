title: ARCTUS â€“ MONITORING REFRIGERATOR CONDENSING UNITS
summary: In the ARCTUS project we develop machine learning (ML) models to monitor refrigerator condensing units (RCU). Such ML models can bring significant value since they provide information on upcoming malfunctions that could stop the operation of an RCU and also predict future energy consumption. For this project we use public datasets as well as data provided by our collaborator Klimamichaniki from Greece.
