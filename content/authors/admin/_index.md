Hello! I'm Yiran Huang, a PhD candidate at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, where I blend Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) with Data Mining to both illuminate the intricate workings of complex AI models and unravel rich insights from large datasets. My mission is to advance AI systems that are not only powerful but also transparent and understandable, ensuring that the intelligence behind decisions is accessible to all. Through my work, I aim to foster trust in AI by making both the models and their derived data insights interpretable and actionable. Join me in exploring the fascinating interplay between XAI and Data Mining, paving the way for a future where technology empowers through clarity as much as capability.
